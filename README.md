    width: 0%;
    height: 2px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin-top: 10px;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -2px;
    left: 0px;
    transition: width 300ms ease-in-out;
}
```
```js
let dataText = [{
    mobile_imgUrl: "./images/mobile-image-hero-1.jpg",
    desktop_imgUrl: "./images/desktop-image-hero-1.jpg",
    title: "Discover innovative ways to decorate",
    description: "We provide unmatched quality, comfort, and style for property owners across the country.Our experts combine form and function in bringing your vision to life. Create a room in your own style with our collection and make your property a reflection of you and what you love."
},

left.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    count--;
if(count<0){
    count = dataText.length-1;
}
    source1.attributes.srcset.nodeValue = dataText[count].desktop_imgUrl;
    source2.attributes.srcset.nodeValue = dataText[count].mobile_imgUrl;
    srcImage.attributes.src.nodeValue = dataText[count].desktop_imgUrl;

    title.innerHTML = dataText[count].title;
    description.innerHTML = dataText[count].description;
})


right.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    count++;
    if(count==dataText.length){
        count=0;
    }
    source1.attributes.srcset.nodeValue = dataText[count].desktop_imgUrl;
    source2.attributes.srcset.nodeValue = dataText[count].mobile_imgUrl;
    srcImage.attributes.src.nodeValue = dataText[count].desktop_imgUrl;

    title.innerHTML = dataText[count].title;
